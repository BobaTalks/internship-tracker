### Opening a Pull Request (PR)

Read about [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

When when the work on your fork is ready to submit, [open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to request that your changes get merged into the main BobaTalks branch.

Code review will be performed by the mentors assigned to this project. If a day or two have passed without any review, please reach out to the project manager assigned to the project, or comment on the pull request to bump it.

## Hosting

This app's frontend is _currently_ hosted on netlify and can be viewed at https://bt-internship-tracker.netlify.app

Pull requests are built with [deploy previews](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/) so reviewers can check out your changes on a live site. Checks on the PR will automatically build this and a link will be provided via comments on your PR.
